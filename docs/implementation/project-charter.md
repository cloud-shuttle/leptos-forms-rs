# Project Charter - Leptos Forms Library

**Project Name**: Leptos Forms
**Project Code**: LF-2025-001
**Charter Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-02
**Project Manager**: [To be assigned]
**Project Sponsor**: [To be assigned]

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Purpose

Create a comprehensive, type-safe, and performant form handling library for Leptos applications that eliminates common form development pain points while providing an exceptional developer experience.

### 1.2 Business Case

The Rust web development ecosystem, particularly around Leptos, lacks a mature, production-ready form library. Current developers must either:

- Build custom form solutions (high development cost, maintenance burden)
- Adapt JavaScript solutions (performance overhead, type safety issues)
- Use basic HTML forms (limited functionality, poor user experience)

**Market Opportunity**:

- Growing Rust web development community (30%+ YoY growth)
- Increasing Leptos adoption in production applications
- Gap in ecosystem tooling creates first-mover advantage
- Enterprise demand for type-safe web development solutions

### 1.3 Project Vision

"To become the definitive form handling solution for Rust web applications, setting the standard for type safety, performance, and developer experience in the Leptos ecosystem."

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals

1. **Developer Experience**: Provide the most intuitive and powerful form API in any web framework
2. **Performance Leadership**: Achieve best-in-class bundle size and runtime performance
3. **Type Safety**: Eliminate entire categories of form-related runtime errors
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless compatibility with popular UI libraries and tools
5. **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade quality, testing, security, and documentation
