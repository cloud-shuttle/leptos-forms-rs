  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register("name", { required: true })} />
      {errors.name && <span>Name is required</span>}

}

#[component]
fn MyForm() -> impl IntoView {
    let form = use_form::<MyForm>();

    let submit = move |_| {
        if form.validate() {
            console_log!("Form data: {:?}", form.get_data());
        }
